# rref-calculator
This reduced row echelon form (RREF) calculator can receive matrices up to a size of 7 rows by 7 columns. It will take a user specified matrix size and inputs then output it in RREF. In mathematics, solving a matrix and transforming it into RREF is essentially solving a system of linear equations. This has many use cases in advanced mathematics across several disciplines such as finance and differential equations. This project was created using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
